            <h2>Competition</h2>
            <p>Our team participates in various robotics competitions throughout the year. In these competitions, we face a lot of different teams and robots. The competition for the website wouldn't directly be the opposing team, but a way for them to see what we were up to. Having this website will bring us out more into the world of VEX and will show teams what we can do.</p>
